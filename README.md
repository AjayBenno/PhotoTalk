# PhotoTalk
#Inspiration
If you've ever played telephone or whisper down the lane, we tried to emulate this for the computer! Our inspiration for this was derived from a want to play these child hood games but over the internet!

#What it does
This program will change your life. Whenever you and your exactly three friends are bored, photo talk is there for you! The application will present a series of images and text for the user, and the user needs to either guess the image's representation or draw his own representation.

#How I built it
We used a python back-end(flask) and used html, css and javascript for the front end.

#Challenges I ran into
We ran into problems when we were using flask to display the websites. Sometimes the website would not properly display our images and the scaling was off sometimes.

#Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Being able to create a full python backend server with little to no prior knowledge. Being able to create an automatic timer that synced all the users based on global time.

#What I learned
We definitely learned more about how server's work and interaction between javascript and api's.

#What's next for Photo Talk
We want to try to scale the app for mobile use. We want to make the website mobile responsive, and add Facebook integration for a more social aspect.
